   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "- **Greedy approach**<br>\n",
    "This heuristic adopts a greedy approach, it always goes towards the nearest object it tries to reach. The risk that the agent takes is very high but in the majority of cases, it finishes in less moves, so in less time. The approach is quite simple, it uses a dictionary of weights, each one of them indicates a priority number, the higher the weight the higher the priority. The object nearest to the agent with the higer priority will be the next target of the agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent's status, health points and bravery**<br>\n",
    "The agent's status is defined by the amount of hp that he has and his brave rate (or threshold). These two values are checked at every step and they play an important role in the selection of the best cell to go in the next move. The brave threshold is common to both of the heuristic, but in this one, the value increases if the agent has a weapon in his hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weight dictionary**<br> \n",
    "This is the data structure in which the weights are defined. There are 3 different configurations for 4 different scenarios. Every scenario is chosen by checking the agent's status and each one of them has a specific weight configuration. The priority in general works as follows: weapon, monster, exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Default mode*: this is the initial setup where the agent has an high amount of hp and he is trying to reach the nearest weapon. In this setup the weights are in descending order from the weapon to the exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Weapon mode*: this setup is used when the agent successfully picks up and wields the weapon. The weapon weight is set to 0 and the monster weight is higher than the exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Danger mode*: this comes into play when the percentage of hp goes lower than the brave threshold. In this setup, the monster weights are set to a negative value, doing so, the agent will try to maximise the distance by the nearest monster. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - *Danger weapon mode*: this is a slightly different mode than the previous one because it comes into play in a different situation. This mode is activated when the hp rate goes under the brave threshold plus the increase of the weapon brave value. This results in a situation where the agent would escape with less hp than normal if it has a weapon to use. The weight configuration, though, is the same for the the danger mode, as it works in the same manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell score calculation**<br>\n",
    "The final calculation is a sum of products that multiplies the weights with the corresponding distances of the objects. This value is calculated at each step for every possible cell where the agent could go. The selected cell will be the one with the lowest value."

    "### Heuristic #2: tactical approach"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    " - **Behavior Personalization**<br>\n",
    "The heuristic aims to implement a tactical strategy for problem resolution by considering the agent's current situation and devising the optimal strategy for that specific scenario. An inherent feature of the heuristic involves the use of pre-defined parameters during design to more effectively balance the impact of environmental characteristics on the agent's choice of the next action.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Strategy Selection**<br>\n",
    "The agent determines whether to adopt a combat, escape, or weapon acquisition strategy. The choice of strategy is influenced by the presence of a weapon on the map. If available, priority is given to acquiring the weapon. Otherwise, the heuristic employs the parameter BRAVE_PLAYER to determine whether the agent should engage in combat or adopt an escape strategy to restore health. The strategies primarily utilize an approach of selecting a target, and based on that, the best move is derived. After fixing a target, a SCORE function is used, suggesting the optimal move by minimizing the Euclidean distance from the target while simultaneously maximizing the distance from monsters, thereby achieving the objective while evading the monsters.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Combat Strategy**<br>\n",
    "To suggest the best cell, the heuristic focuses on identifying an optimal candidate monster among those present on the map to be taken as the target. The target selection is weighted, choosing the monster that minimizes the distance from the agent, penalized by the number of monsters around it.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Escape Strategy**<br>\n",
    "The escape strategy is carefully implemented to address critical situations. The heuristic aims to maximize the distance from monsters, giving higher priority to those closer. However, recognizing the potential pitfalls of entrapment, the heuristic checks if the agent is in a trap situation. This is assessed by considering the number of monsters near the player and their angular disposition. In the case of a trap, a different strategy is adopted guiding the agent towards the map corner farthest from the monsters.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Weapon Acquisition Strategy**<br>\n",
    "When the agent seeks to acquire a weapon, the heuristic uses Euclidean distance as the primary metric. However, the optimal cell suggestion also takes into account the need to distance oneself from monsters, minimizing the risk of being surrounded or attacked. The agent, therefore, selects the cell that approaches the desired target while ensuring a safe distance from surrounding monsters."

   "source": [
    "The agent's **hit points** are an index of its health state: the default starting number of hit points is 16, but they can go down because of the monsters' attacks or grow thanks to the level ups, even exceeding the default value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, we want the agent to always win the game, meaning that we can't let it get killed easily when the health is not strong. That's why our heuristics also contain a check that triggers a sort of *alert mode*, making the agent run away from danger. \n",
    "Taking into consideration that the agent can recover the hit points by leveling up or waiting without fighting, the best move when it has poor health becomes... *Run ~~boy~~ agent, run*! 🏃 \n",
    "\n",
    "This escape mode is developed differently in the two heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **first heuristic** involves the presence of a BRAVE variable, which indicates the agent's courage. A percentage is constantly calculated that relates BRAVE to the number of hit points of the agent: the higher the value of BRAVE, the lower this percentage must be in order for the agent to continue on his or her usual path, going towards the weapon to be collected or the monsters to be fought. If, on the other hand, the agent is set as less brave, then a higher percentage will suffice to trigger the escape. The heuristics are set up in such a way as to push the agent towards corners, where it can take refuge until the monsters approach. Once it realises it has one close by, it always moves to the edge of the room.\n",
    "- The **second heuristic**, on the other hand, involves the use of a different set of weights that also uses negative values assigned to the monsters to make the agent move in the opposite direction to them. If the agent has already picked up the weapon, then it will only flee if the percentage of hit points remaining compared to the highest value recorded is lower than 40%, because it has a better chance of not dying in combat and will probably be able to move on in the game. Otherwise, it will flee if it has less than 50% of the hit points.\n",

So, together we researched and selected the basic features of the game. Then, we divided into two subgroups corresponding to the heuristics to be developed: one group, consisting of Francesca Poli and Daniele Bedini, developed the greedy heuristics, while the group of Gioele Modica and Giovanni Criscione created the tactical heuristics. After finishing the refinement of the two heuristics, all together we did statistical analyses and plots on the performance of the two heuristics compared to a baseline with a random approach, and together we wrote the report explaining each work step."

    "In this section, the aim is to compare the two heuristics emphasising the disparity between the **greedy** and the **tactical** approach. Several tests were conducted on two maps with a parameter indicating courage, called **brave** parameter: one in which the agent starts in less critical conditions and the other where the agent starts already surrounded by monsters. \n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison parameters concern the health and the number of steps of the agent. In order to set a baseline for our results and validate our statistics, we also inserted an analysis of the behaviour of an agent that moves completely randomly, without any heuristics. This was made in order to illustrate how easily an agent without any reasoning fails. \n",
    "\n",
    "The performance evaluation is based on the **percentage of health points** and the **number of steps** at the end of execution. A selection of two significant plots for each task has been made."

    "During execution with the *brave* parameter's threshold set to **1**, the agent shows an inclination to attack monsters regardless of the current life percentage. From the graphs, it emerges that the heuristic with the greedy approach (#1) tends to lose more life than the one that exploits a tactical approach (#2), as it aims to attack the closest monster with the goal of minimising the number of steps, without worrying about the surrounding monsters. This heuristic almost always succeeds in eliminating all monsters with fewer steps, but at the cost of putting the health at serious risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tactical heuristic (#2) takes more steps, but selects the targets more wisely, based not only on distance but also on the number of monsters around the said hypothetical target. In contrast to the greedy approach, one observes that the agent tends to take a higher number of steps, but manages to maximise the health percentage, trying to keep it as high as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](img/combattimento1.png \"Title\") \n",
    "\n",
    "During execution with the *brave* parameter's threshold set to **0**, the agent shows a propensity to constantly flee from monsters. The greedy heuristic's results, shown in the plots as heuristic #1, demonstrate that the strategy of escaping from monsters is more risky than the other heuristic, as it also tends to consider to move on dangerous cells that might allow the agent to escape from a group of monsters, but also lead the agent towards another group of lethal creatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the graphs, the greedy heuristic often succeeds in recovering health and evading the monsters, but with a higher level of risk. In contrast, the tactical approach (#2) shows greater success as it tends to choose safer routes, focusing on the totality of the monsters rather than a single subgroup, thus ensuring a safer and more consistent escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we conducted a test on the same map using a **random approach** (plotted in green) in which the agent randomly selects the next move. As the plots show, as soon as the agent is reached by monsters, it shows an immediate tendency to die, as it does not make decisions by evaluating perceptions of the current environment."

    "In this context we generated a map by positioning the monsters so that the agent starts in a trap situation, creating a more difficult environment. \n",
    "We set the *brave* parameter's threshold to **0.5** in order to achieve a compromise between escape and combat mode. The plots of two different tests show that this task requires more steps even for the greedy heuristic (#1) which tends to apply almost constantly the escape mode, which allows not only to run away from monsters but also to face some of them in critical situations such as being surrounded. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tactical heuristic (#2), on the other hand, tends to initially move as far away from the monsters as possible and running away from the trap situation in order to recover life, and then face them with more confidence. We can see that both heuristics mostly tend to complete the task, but in this case the greedy heuristic can get about twice as many steps to perform. Moreover, we performed a further test with the random moving agent, showing that in this case it tends to die immediately, absolutely unable to escape from the trap situation.\n"

    "Our objective for this project was to implement an agent who plays NetHack independently, aiming to kill all monsters before finishing the level. We managed to develop the project successfully by creating two original heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "New developments of heuristics could also be created that would allow the agent to be able to juggle even more difficult environments. For example, it would be interesting to also include new skills of the agent, even just the standard NetHack ones like picking food or treasures, and see how the domain of heuristics could be increased. Another interesting development would be to make the agent capable of dealing with different monsters from each other in one level, which is a very complex task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, it is interesting to note that in addressing the difficulties of the task, we wrote two innovative heuristics that differ from each other, but still have their own similarities in finding solutions. We are sure that this is an excellent start and a cue to eventually improve and expand them, or apply them even in new contexts in which to develop them to their fullest capacity."
